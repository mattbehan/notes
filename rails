The default environment in Rails is development. If you ever need to run the console in another environment, just specify it as an argument (rails console test)
In order to VIEW it in a different environment, run it with rails server --environment production
  however, you will have to run a production migration (rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production)
you can check the environment by saying Rails.env
